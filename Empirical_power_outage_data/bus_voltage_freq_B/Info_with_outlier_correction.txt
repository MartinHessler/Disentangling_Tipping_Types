polynom_noise_trend_B_ws2000.npy and 
polynom_slope_trend_B_ws2000.npy

contain arrays of shape (number_of_windows, 3). The last index denotes

0 mode of the estimate,
1 lower 16%-percentile bound,
2 upper 84%-percentile bound.

The outer 1%-/99%-percentile bounds are saved in
polynom_sigma_storage_ws2000.npy of shape (2,number_of_windows,2)
with the first index denoting the slopes by 0 and the noise level by 1.
