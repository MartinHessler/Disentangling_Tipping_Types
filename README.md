# Disentangling Tipping Types
Contains the synthetic and empirical data as well as supplementary material of the corresponding publication "Disentangling Tipping-Types in power outage data". The analysis can be performed with the Python package "antiCPy".

Python scripts in the folder "Quantifying_Local_Stability_and_Noise_Levels" are compatible with antiCPy Version 1.0.0. Some earlier versions should work as well. There is no guarantee that future versions may require modifications of the provided scripts. In general, the plot scripts can be directly executed relying on the uploaded analysis results. However, the analysis results can be previously reproduced using the computation scripts.
