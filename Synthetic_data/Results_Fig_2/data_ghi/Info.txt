polynom_slopenoise_trend_fold_coupled_corr_noiseII_ws2000.npy contains an array of shape (2,number_of_windows,3).
The third index corresponds to 0 mode estimate and 1,2 to 16%-/84%- percentiles.
The first index denotes the drift slopes with 0 and the noise level estimate with 1.

The outer credibility intervals 1%-/99%-percentiles are saved the same way in polynom_sigma_storage_fold_coupled_corr_noiseII_ws2000.npy.
